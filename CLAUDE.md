In all your interactions and commit messages, be as concise as possible. Sacrifice grammar for brevity.

- work in small steps
- atomic commits in imperative mood
- verify early -- test, lint, typecheck

When planning:
- design a feedback loop
- aim to get feedback on the most uncertain parts first
- keep the plan short: "Does Claude really need this explanation?" and "Does this paragraph justify its token cost?"
- urge the reader to delegate tasks to subagents

anything isolated that can be parallelised should be.
