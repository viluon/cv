      - company: "[Deutsche Börse Group](https://deutsche-boerse.com/)"
        position: Senior software engineer
        location: Prague, Czech Republic

          We're building a new commodity exchange in the [M7 product
          family](https://deutsche-boerse.com/dbg-en/markets-services/ps-technology/ps-7-market-technology/ps-m7),
          in Kotlin, from scratch. It's a highly available 24/7 distributed
          system with complex compliance requirements, where millisecond latency
          matters and fairness is critical.

          I joined DBAG as the third engineer to work on this project full-time.
          Since then, both the team and the project have grown.

          We work like a startup nested within a large corporation, without
          Scrum, stand-ups, ceremonies, sprints, or estimates#footnote[Our team
          follows https://agilemanifesto.org/, not some corporate framework.].
          We had the chance to escape legacy constraints while building on the
          organizational experience of developing and operating commodity
          exchanges like [EPEX](https://www.epexspot.com/en) and
          [XBID](https://www.epexspot.com/en/news/european-cross-border-intraday-xbid-solution-and-10-local-implementation-projects-successful).
